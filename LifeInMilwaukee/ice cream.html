  <h1>Ice Cream</h1>
  <p>Since Wisconsin is known as the dairy state, we have lots of tasty dairy products, one of them being ice cream.<p>
  <p>Here are some of the top ice cream places in Milwaukee:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Kopps's Frozen Custard</li>
  <li>Leon's Frozen Custard</li>
  <li>The Purple Door</li>
  </ol>
    <p>Vanilla custard has a slightly different taste from regular vanilla ice cream, however, it is definitely worth a try if you haven't had custard before.</p>
